    "You will create a Jupyter Notebook using IBM Watson Studio. You can choose any language you want (Python, R, or Scala). You will need to include a combination of markdown and code cells. You will likely need to use the Markdown cheatsheet to help you determine the appropriate syntax to style your markdown.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cell 1 (rendered as Markdown): The title should be \"My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio\", in H1 header styling. The title does not need to be centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell 2 (rendered as Markdown): Include your name, in bold characters. In the line below your name, write your current or desired occupation in regular font.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell 3 (rendered as Markdown): In italic formatting, write one or two sentences about why you are interested in data science. For example, you can start your first sentence with \"I am interested in data science because ...\".\n",
